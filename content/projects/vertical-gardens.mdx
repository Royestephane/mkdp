## Introduction

Vertical Gardens reimagines high-density urban living in Beirut, integrating 200+ native plant species across 32 stories to create a truly living facade.

## Environmental Strategy

Each apartment features a private planted terrace that provides natural insulation, reducing cooling loads by 30%. Automated irrigation systems recycle greywater from residential units.

The building's staggered form maximizes natural ventilation and ensures every unit receives direct sunlight for at least 4 hours daily—critical for both plant health and resident wellbeing.

## Construction Progress

Currently 70% complete, with structural work finished and facade installation underway. Completion is scheduled for Q2 2025.

## Urban Impact

The project will add 120 residential units to Beirut's housing stock while creating 4,000 m² of urban greenery—equivalent to a medium-sized public park.
