## Introduction

The Innovation Tech Hub proposes a new model for Lebanon's growing technology sector: a carbon-negative office building that prioritizes flexibility, collaboration, and occupant wellbeing.

## Design Vision

Six floors of adaptable workspace surround a central atrium that serves as the building's social and environmental core. Natural ventilation, daylighting, and biophilic design principles create a healthy indoor environment that reduces reliance on mechanical systems.

## Sustainability Goals

Targeting LEED Platinum and net-zero operational carbon through:

- CLT structure that sequesters 1,200 tons of CO₂
- 300 kW rooftop solar array
- Radiant heating/cooling with geothermal heat pumps
- Rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling

## Flexible Infrastructure

Modular workspace systems allow tenants to reconfigure layouts without construction waste. Raised floors accommodate evolving technology needs while providing efficient HVAC distribution.

## Status

Currently seeking development partners and municipal approvals. Projected groundbreaking in 2026 if funding is secured.
