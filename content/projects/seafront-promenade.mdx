## Introduction

The Seafront Promenade transforms a neglected industrial waterfront into a vibrant 1.2-kilometer pedestrian corridor, reconnecting Jounieh's residents with the Mediterranean coastline.

## Design Strategy

Working within a narrow strip between existing buildings and the sea, we created a series of distinct zones: active recreation areas, contemplative seating pockets, and native plant gardens that support local biodiversity.

The design celebrates the natural coastline rather than imposing rigid geometry, with the pathway undulating to accommodate existing mature trees and geological features.

## Materiality

Local limestone paving provides a continuous surface that recalls traditional Lebanese coastal architecture. Hardwood benches and decking create warm gathering spaces, while Corten steel planters age gracefully in the salt air.

## Community Engagement

Through three years of public workshops, we incorporated community feedback into every design decision, resulting in 85% resident satisfaction rating post-completion.
