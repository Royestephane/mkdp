## Introduction

Plaza Marina activates Tripoli's historic port district, creating a 6,200 m² pedestrian square that serves as a gathering space for residents and a gateway for visitors arriving by sea.

## Urban Context

The plaza sits at the intersection of Tripoli's medieval souks and its modernist port infrastructure. Our design mediates between these contrasting urban fabrics through careful material selection and spatial organization.

## Key Features

A choreographed water feature provides cooling and acoustic masking from traffic. Programmable lighting transforms the plaza after dark, supporting evening markets and cultural events.

Over 40 mature trees—primarily drought-tolerant Mediterranean species—provide shade while requiring minimal irrigation.

## Public Life

Since completion, the plaza hosts a weekly farmers market (800+ visitors), summer concert series, and daily use by residents as a car-free public space in a car-dominated city.
