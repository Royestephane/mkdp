## Introduction

Carved into a hillside in Batroun's historic quarter, the Stone Gallery provides a contemporary exhibition space within the fabric of a UNESCO-protected village.

## Context & Constraint

Working within strict heritage guidelines, we designed the gallery as a modern insertion that respects the scale, material, and construction logic of surrounding vernacular architecture.

The building's footprint follows property lines established in the Ottoman period, with new construction distinguishable through precise detailing rather than contrasting materials.

## Spatial Experience

Natural light animates the gallery throughout the day. North-facing clerestories provide consistent illumination for art display, while a central oculus creates dramatic shadow patterns that shift with the sun's path.

## Construction

Local masons employed traditional techniques—some dating to Phoenician times—to construct the load-bearing stone walls. Contemporary steel and glass elements were fabricated off-site and inserted with millimeter precision.
